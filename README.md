# Parallel DQN 
DQN and Reinforce implementation

```python test_car.py``` will run the dqn training code.

```python vpg.py``` will run the Reinforce code.


### Abstractions

Each algorithm inherits from the ```Agent``` class and the CarDQN code inherits from the ```ParallelDQN``` code.

A video of the DQN agent running on car racing is given [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpS3hjr3bFQ&ab_channel=KaranbirChahal)
